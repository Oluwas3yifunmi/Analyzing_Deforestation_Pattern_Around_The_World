## INTRODUCTION
Global deforestation has been a contributing factor to climate change, where carbon is released into the atmosphere from the cutting down or burning of trees. These trees serve as stores for carbon which helps to stabilise the planet's atmosphere, cutting down or burning these trees releases carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Deforestation occurs primarily in areas with large forest areas such as the Amazon Basin of South America, the Congo Basin in Central Africa and also Southeast Asia, reasons for deforestation around each of these region differs but can range from the clearing of forest for agricultural products, cultivation, urbanization etc. 
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The objective of the analysis is to get insight into the similar features and characteristics of companies involved in deforestation such as their total land area, forest area, country's income group and their region. These features and patterns are helpful in helping us determine the country that might be most involved in deforestation and provide insight into the factors that might influenced the rate of deforestation in each of these countries.
## UNDERSTANDING THE DATASET 
The dataset provided is made up of 3 tables which are; the forest area, the regions, and the land area. The forest area table consists of 4 columns (country code, country name, year and the forest area in square kilometres) and 5886 rows of data, the regions table is made up of 4 columns (country name, country code, region and income group) and 219 rows of data, and finally, the land area is made up of 4 columns (country code, country name, year and total land area in square miles) and 5886 rows of data.
